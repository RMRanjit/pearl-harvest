This year has proven to us again, that the barri-\ners left-behind children stand up against, will require \nlong-term sustained efforts. \nAt the time of writing, the world is dealing with the \nconsequences of a pandemic that threatens children’s \nrights world-wide, and that further exacerbates the \nvulnerabilities of the most marginalised children. Pro-\ngress made towards the Sustainable Development \nGoals are at risk. We have a momentous job in the \nremaining four years to turn the tide for the children \nleft behind and come closer to the still valid vision of \nour founding mother.\nBirgitte Lange","metadata":{"source":"/Users/m_106904/Documents/Code/pearl-harvest/src/app/sessions/Another set of Sample files/Annual Report 2019_Norad.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign 15.0 (Macintosh)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 15.0","CreationDate":"D:20200529150830+02'00'","ModDate":"D:20200529152230+02'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2020-05-29T15:08:30+02:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2020-05-29T15:22:30+02:00","xmp:modifydate":"2020-05-29T15:22:30+02:00","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign 15.0 (Macintosh)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:3cc35e1b-428d-f54d-a0e5-3c5f3900324b","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:94569a6a-3c19-4d47-988f-23a4f75bcfd4","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:d101fdfa-292b-4639-bd72-6e0ca6cc52e8","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:f0459f8b-4c80-45d7-80b3-f370150b5837xmp.did:c791387b-d8b4-46ad-a396-9568d0633d7fxmp.did:94569a6a-3c19-4d47-988f-23a4f75bcfd4default","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign 15.0 (Macintosh)/2020-05-29T15:08:30+02:00","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 15.0","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":3,"lines":{"from":34,"to":53}}}}],["c6d5935e-27a0-47e9-8d0e-34baba2cb862",{"pageContent":"remaining four years to turn the tide for the children \nleft behind and come closer to the still valid vision of \nour founding mother.\nBirgitte Lange\nCEO of Save the Children Norway \nPHOTO: NORA LIE / REDD BARNA\nREPORT 2019 \n•\n REDD BARNA\n 3","metadata":{"source":"/Users/m_106904/Documents/Code/pearl-harvest/src/app/sessions/Another set of Sample files/Annual Report 2019_Norad.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign 15.0 (Macintosh)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 15.0","CreationDate":"D:20200529150830+02'00'","ModDate":"D:20200529152230+02'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2020-05-29T15:08:30+02:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2020-05-29T15:22:30+02:00","xmp:modifydate":"2020-05-29T15:22:30+02:00","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign 15.0 (Macintosh)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:3cc35e1b-428d-f54d-a0e5-3c5f3900324b","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:94569a6a-3c19-4d47-988f-23a4f75bcfd4","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:d101fdfa-292b-4639-bd72-6e0ca6cc52e8","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:f0459f8b-4c80-45d7-80b3-f370150b5837xmp.did:c791387b-d8b4-46ad-a396-9568d0633d7fxmp.did:94569a6a-3c19-4d47-988f-23a4f75bcfd4default","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign 15.0 (Macintosh)/2020-05-29T15:08:30+02:00","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 15.0","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":3,"lines":{"from":50,"to":59}}}}],["a5b289d7-864b-4cf2-9953-dd40177c3dde",{"pageContent":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe Leaving No Child Behind programme’s ambition \nis to secure children’s right to education and pro-\ntection, with a particular focus on gender equality \nand inclusion.
